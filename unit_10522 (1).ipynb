    "There are various Python APIs such as [Webhose](http://webhose.io/), [NewsAPI](http://newsapi.org/pricing), [News Fetch](https://pypi.org/project/news-fetch/), [GoogleNews](http://pypi.org/project/GoogleNews/) etc. which aggregate news headlines from various media sources. The framework for using these APIs/libraries are somewhat similar. \n",

    "1. Install and import the library\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Get API key (Not required in some cases)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use filters such as keywords, language, timeframe etc. \n",
